# Starbucks-Project
## Intro
The aim of this project is to gain insights into Starbucksâ€™ queueing process, specifically looking at the impact of mobile ordering which allows customers to skip the physical cash queue and head straight to the bar. This poses operational questions for Starbucks as they need to manage server allocation between the bar and cash.
